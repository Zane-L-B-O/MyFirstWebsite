            I lived in Goose Creek for a good few years of my childhood but I don't remember much so I cant describe much. 
            Cottageville is a peaceful place nice and quiet as long as the neighbors aren't hunting or throwing a party but it has a few general stores, gas stations, not that many people (both nice and mean), and good food.
            North Charleston is where I've gone through my entire highschool life and it's what you expect of a city, a lot of people, traffic, a bunch of gas stations, stores, resturants, and a bunch of other things you'd expect in a city except for sky scrapers.

            I always wanted to visit Japan since it's an interesting place and they have a lot of nice things there like vending machines everywhere, arcade games that use more than just a controller, the list goes on like why do you not want to visit it so I chose Tokyo.
            I chose Pearl City since Hawaii sounds like a nice place to be since there's a lot to do over there and I want to visit the islands since there's a lot of animals near the island so why no see them in the wild?
            I chose Dalvik since Iceland has wonderful areas of landscapes and it's mostly a relaxing place but I didn't kniw which city to pick so I looked througha few of them and decided to choose Dalvik.
